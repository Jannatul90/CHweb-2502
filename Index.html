    <p>Zhenel Rawlinson grew up surrounded by music in Memphis, Tennessee. With a mother who was a recording artist and a father who worked as a Hip Hop producer, music was ingrained in her life from an early age. “I was always involved in music, whether it was at church, school, or in the community,” she said. By the time she was a teenager, she had recorded her first album in her father’s home studio.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But while music was her passion, financial stability was harder to come by. As the first in her family to attend college, Zhenel knew she needed a way to make ends meet while pursuing her goals. That’s when she decided to offer music lessons, starting with just two students. Over time, what began as a modest side gig blossomed into a $1,000-a-month income stream. </p>
